> - In JavaScript, build a function that checks if a word is a palindrome (reads
>   the same backwards as forwards, e.g. kayak, rotator, radar etc). If the word
>   is a palindrome, function should return true, else, false.

> - In JavaScript: given an array of objects:
>   - Order the people by age in descending order
>   - Order the people by name alphabetically A-Z
>   - Pull just the ages into a new array

Both the functions are in the **js** folder.

1.  The `palindrome.js` can be further reformed based on requirements by :

    - converting input to lower or upper case.
    - using regex to remove spaces , special characters, and/or numbers.

2.  Array functions added in `array.js`
